# Rate My Externship

Audiology externs lack adequate resources sharing their experiences. As a consequence, new externs struggle for information about externships. Our client, Professor Venkitakrishnan, has a critical need for  a website that can improve this situation. What is needed here is a website similar to “Rate My Professor”. That is what we will deliver in this project. The key difference here is this we will be rating externships instead of rating professors. The client expects this site to fulfill a critical need in her field. This will help students seeking externships. This website will serve both as a valuable resource for students looking to apply for externships and a data collection tool for departmental researchers. This project is planned to be completed at the end of May, 2024.
